Eleanor,

	My name is Tim Racinsky and I'm writing to you on behalf of 
David Huron.  David is away at some conferences now and he wanted me 
to send some information to you that might be of assistance in encoding 
musical scores.  I have included a small part of the revised documentation 
as well as a disk containing some important files.

	The documentation contains information on humdrum syntax and 
kern syntax.  The documentation for the humdrum command has also been 
included since the humdrum program is on the accompanying disk.  The file 
'humdrum.exe' can be found on the disk and is to be used as a humdrum syntax 
checker.  Any humdrum related encoding errors should be located by using 
this program.  Along with this program I have included a series of small 
test files which provide an example of all possible error messages produced 
by the humdrum program.  These files are labelled error1 to error22.  Five 
warning files are also included.  These warnings are not humdrum errors 
but the given humdrum file may become invalid when used with other humdrum 
programs.

	The humdrum program may be invoked with 'humdrum [option=v] filename'.
(Note that this is slightly different than the accompanying command
documentation for reasons I will not go into right now).

	I hope this will be of some assistance to you.  If you have 
any questions please feel free to e-mail us at:
