## GNU makefile for Humdrum Toolkit
##
## Description: This Makefile will compile C programs in the toolkit-source
##		directory, then copy all humdrum programs and help files
##		into the bin directory.  To compile the C programs, you must 
##		first have gcc installed on your computer.  Windows users 
##		should install in the cygwin unix terminal (available from 
##		http://www.cygwin.com).
##
## To run this makefile, type (without quotes) "make".  After successful
## compiling, you must add the bin directory to your command search path.
## This can be done automatically with the command "make install".
