The Humdrum Toolkit: Software Tools for Music Research

                    David Huron

     Humdrum provides a general-purpose set of software tools that
facilitates research-related music applications.  Humdrum is able to
represent a large range of music information, from French lute tablatures
to Dagomba dance gestures.  In addition, the toolkit provides software
for searching, extracting, classifying, labeling, comparing, and otherwise
manipulating the musical data.  The Humdrum tools are increasingly used to
build more specific applications software.  The presentation will include
a demonstration of "Themefinder" -- a web-based "name-that-tune" search
engine created using Humdrum tools.
