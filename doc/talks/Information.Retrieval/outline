Information Retrieval Using the Humdrum Toolkit

OUTLINE

	* In the age of the internet, what is the relationship between librarians and
	traditional researchers?
	* Eliminating the "Reference Question Boundary"
	* Goals of CCARH Web Site
	* Organiztion of CCARH Web Site
	* Use of Humdrum Toolkit
	* Themefinder

-------------------------------------------------------

Traditional Division of Labors:

LIBRARIANS

	* acquisitions
	* maintain collections
	* provide pointers to information

RESEARCHERS

	* follow the pointers
	* interpret the information
	* generate new information

-------------------------------------------------------

THE (NEW?) REALITY

LIBRARIANS

	* Because librarians have access to information
	and have an informed understanding of materials,
	they are very well placed to do original research.
	* Librarians often produce reference tools that are
	themselves "primary sources".

RESEARCHERS

	* engaged in acquisitions (usually "personal collections")
	* with the Web: citations are becoming direct links
	(overlapping with the traditional task of reference librarians)

THE REFERENCE QUESTION BOUNDARY

QUESTIONS:

What year did Dvorak write the New World Symphony?

Where can I find works written for bassoon and string quartet?

How many cantatas did Bach write?

I'm looking for a list of works written in irregular meters - like 7/8.

Do Italian sixth chords occur more commonly in Italian music?

Are German drinking songs more likely to be in triple meter?

Which English translation of a Schubert text best preserves
the vowel coloration?

I'm looking for an example where two different melodies
use the same lyrics.

When does a reference question become a research question?
