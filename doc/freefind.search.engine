Thanks for choosing FreeFind!

Now your just a few steps away from improving your site with:
   1) The leading free site search engine,
   2) A handy "Site Map" - generated automatically, and
   3) A "What's New" page - a must for repeat visitors.

This e-mail includes all the information you need to get 
started.  Please keep this e-mail for future reference.

Using FreeFind is easy.  All you need to do is:
   1) Ask our spider to index your site, and
   2) Copy the HTML from this e-mail and paste it into your 
      web page(s).

STEP 1: INDEXING YOUR SITE

    To have our spider index your site just go the FreeFind
    Control Center at: 

        http://www.freefind.com/control.html   

    Enter your site's URL, e-mail address and password as 
    shown below, then press the "spider site" button.  Our
    spider will index your site and e-mail you when it's 
    done. The spider will also build a Site Map of your site
    and generate a What's New page.

    Your account information is as follows:
        Site URL: http://www.humdrum.net/
        E-mail  : huron.1@osu.edu
        Password: 435754114
        Site ID : 7111222



STEP 2: ADDING HTML TO YOUR SITE PAGE(S)

    At the bottom of this e-mail is the HTML you need to 
    paste into your web site to make FreeFind work. There
    are two HTML segments, one for that creates a search panel, 
    and one for that provides text links to your search and
    site map.
    
    Most professional sites have all of these options 
    prominently displayed on every page of their site. 
    You can too, by pasting the provided HTML into each 
    page of your site. Remember: don't make your visitors
    search for search!
    
    To modify your pages use a text editor, or whatever 
    HTML editing tool you normally use, to copy then paste
    each HTML segment into the pages of your web site.

    After you have received word (via e-mail) from our 
    spider that your site has been indexed, you're finished!
    Visitors can now search your site for specific text,
    navigate around your site using a handy map of your site,
    and also find out what's new since last time they were
    there.

STEP 3: (optional) CUSTOMIZE YOUR FreeFind RESULTS

    FreeFind can be customized to have the same look as your
    web site! To do this, go to the FreeFind Control Center 
    at: 

        http://www.freefind.com/control.html

    Click on the "Customize search" button to customize the
    look of your search results. Click on the "Setup site
    map" to customize your site maps.

REPORTS

    To see what visitors to your site have been searching 
    for, go to the Control Center and click on the 
    "Reports" button.
