There are two ways to utilize the file humdrum.vim in the vim editor:

Manual loading
==============

You can load the colorizing for Humdrum data manually by typing the following 
command inside of the vim editor (giving a path name to humdrum.vim if i
is not in the current directory):
     :so humdrum.vim


Automatic loading
=================

* First, add these lines to a file in your home directory called .vimrc:
     syntax on
     au BufRead,BufNewFile *.hmd set filetype=humdrum 
     au BufRead,BufNewFile *.krn set filetype=humdrum 
     au! Syntax humdrum  source ~/.vim/humdrum.vim

  where .hmd and .krn are file extensions that you want to associate 
  with the Humdrum syntax coloring. 

* Then copy the humdrum.vim file into the location ~/.vim/humdrum.vim.
